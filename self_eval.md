# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled with part 3 of hashes_2! Adding a conditional to the mix after having just learned how to iterate hashes had me scratching my head a little bit, but I sorted it out after a while.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I just got a notebook and tested out handwriting notes as I read along the through the hashes topic. I would say it was successful, I felt that taking the time to write it down after reading it allowed me to truly process the info.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I definitely spent too much time googling with no results for me to finish part 3 of hashes_2. What it took was for me to walk away, eat some lunch, stretch a little, and then I was able to come up with a solution. I am happy I figured it out on my own, not as happy with how long it took to finish this assingment.
